She found a bug
It works on my machine
I pushed a fix
We closed the issue

## Notes

Welcome to Steno Etudes for Developers..
and to your first etude!

Here are a few thoughts on your first lesson:

`machine` is one of my favorite words to write in steno;
the stroke, `PH-PB` -> `M-N`, is quick and memorable.

`issue` is not quite as quick to write,
but also feels clever once it becomes more familiar:
`*EURB` -> `SH`
