# Etude 12: The tickets must flow

```
Can you open a ticket for that issue?
Is the priority low, medium, or high?
When is the due date?

Let's look at the todo column.
How many tickets are in testing?
Is that in the done column?
Do we want to mark this as blocked?
What's the status of the spike?
Are there any tasks left
before we can close that out?

I assigned the story to you,
but I can pick it up if that would help.

There are five stories in the epic,
and this epic belongs to the initiative we just started.

You can find our board under the project view.

This filter returns all of the tickets
assigned to members of our team.

We may need to punt this ticket because of
new work added to the sprint.

Does your team use t-shirt sizes
or the Fibonacci sequence
for estimating tickets?

Open the burn down chart.
On second thought, let's look at the burn up chart.
The trend is looking good so far.

How many points has the team committed to?
When is the sprint finished?

Do we follow a two week sprint cadence?
How many sprints are left this quarter?
We are about halfway through this fiscal year.

I created a stub ticket during our planning session.

Are we ready to kick off the sprint?
