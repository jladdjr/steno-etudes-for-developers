# Etude 9: Automation

```
The job is waiting, pending, starting, running.
It failed, passed, succeeded.

I cancelled it after a timeout due to a network connection error.
The task runs on a schedule but stopped after five retries.

The artifacts include a log which shows a stacktrace.

The worker is low on resources and went offline.

The third stage is running and it's being deployed now.

The project uses a pipeline with five braches.

The job detected a code change and is spinning up now.

The gate check passed and is triggering the final job.
