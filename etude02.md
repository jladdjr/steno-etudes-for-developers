##  Notes

This little section looks easy enough
but - for me at least - is full of gotchas.
If left unpracticed, these gotchas will become speed bumps.

`Created` is a speed bump for me because my mind stops to ask:

_"Should the stroke use A and E (`AE`), because 'created' has these two letters in it?
Or should I use the stroke for a long E (`AOE`) here instead?"_

This is a fair question -- I have seen both of these patterns used in strokes,
so it makes sense that my mind would find itself at a fork in the road.

That little debate happens inside my head every time I try to write this word!
What to do?

In cases like this, the following process has helped me work through things:

1. Notice the speed bump. No judgment here, just notice what is happening.
2. Try practicing the word. Continue to notice what your mind says as you write the word.
3. As you repeat the word, start to notice how your mind sees different paths and chooses one or another. Practice the word as slowly as you need to in order to notice the questions that come up in the back of your mind.
4. Explore different ways of thinking of the word and begin to try to encourage your mind to move toward the correct stroke.
5. Continue this process until your mind starts to prefer the correct stroke. Focus on noticing, and try to maintain a spirit of gently encouraging your thoughts in a helpful direction. Explore different mnemonics, different associations, different patterns that make it a little easier for your mind to move this way instead of that way.

This may seem like a huge amount of time to commit to just a single word.
How in the world could we study every tricky word with this level of attention?

The good news is that I think that by slowly working through this one word
and the questions that come up when you write it,
you are helping your mind with all of the other words that fall into a similar pattern.
So, instead of helping out just this one word, you are helping your mind
anytime it approaches a similar case.

Another way that this kind of study has a hidden economy of scale is that
by giving this kind of care to a *common* word, you are helping yourself be successful
with a word that you will likely see *all the time*.

A final thought.

One thing that I love about the approach that I outlined here is that
it helps me to approach challenging speed bumps with curiosity.
One reason why I love steno is that it gives me an excuse to spend time with things I love:
words, thinking, language, patterns, and
the challenge of building a sense of mastery with something beautiful.

What helps you to stay curious along the way?
